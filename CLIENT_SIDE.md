## Client Side

Using a `GraphQL Client` - a bonding layer between react and the graph ql server. Language agnostic.

Top choices:

- 1. Lokka - Very simple, basic queries, mutations & caching.
- 2. Apollo Client - Good balance between features and complexity. Downside - made by meteorJS guys, not much experience in graphql clients.(Paid for service)
- 3. Good performance for mobile applications. Very complex.


### Query Variables

These can be used to inject data inside mutations
